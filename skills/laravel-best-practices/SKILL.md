# Laravel Best Practices

Best practices for Laravel, prioritized by impact. Each rule teaches what to do and why. For exact API syntax, verify with `search-docs`.

## Consistency First

Before applying any rule, check what the application already does. Laravel offers multiple valid approaches — the best choice is the one the codebase already uses, even if another pattern would be theoretically better. Inconsistency is worse than a suboptimal pattern.

Check sibling files, related controllers, models, or tests for established patterns. If one exists, follow it — don't introduce a second way. These rules are defaults for when no pattern exists yet, not overrides.

## Quick Reference

### 1. Database Performance → `references/db-performance.md`

- Eager load with `with()` to prevent N+1 queries
- Enable `Model::preventLazyLoading()` in development
- Select only needed columns, avoid `SELECT *`
- `chunk()` / `chunkById()` for large datasets
- Index columns used in `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`
- `withCount()` instead of loading relations to count
- `cursor()` for memory-efficient read-only iteration
- Never query in Blade templates

### 2. Advanced Query Patterns → `references/advanced-queries.md`

- `addSelect()` subqueries over eager-loading entire has-many for a single value
- Dynamic relationships via subquery FK + `belongsTo`
- Conditional aggregates (`CASE WHEN` in `selectRaw`) over multiple count queries
- `setRelation()` to prevent circular N+1 queries
- `whereIn` + `pluck()` over `whereHas` for better index usage
- Two simple queries can beat one complex query
- Compound indexes matching `orderBy` column order
- Correlated subqueries in `orderBy` for has-many sorting (avoid joins)

### 3. Security → `references/security.md`, `references/passport.md`, `references/spatie-laravel-permission.md`

- Define `$fillable` or `$guarded` on every model, authorize every action via policies or gates
- No raw SQL with user input — use Eloquent or query builder
- `{{ }}` for output escaping, `@csrf` on all POST/PUT/DELETE forms, `throttle` on auth and API routes
- Validate MIME type, extension, and size for file uploads
- Never commit `.env`, use `config()` for secrets, `encrypted` cast for sensitive DB fields

### 4. Caching → `references/caching.md`

- `Cache::remember()` over manual get/put
- `Cache::flexible()` for stale-while-revalidate on high-traffic data
- `Cache::memo()` to avoid redundant cache hits within a request
- Cache tags to invalidate related groups
- `Cache::add()` for atomic conditional writes
- `once()` to memoize per-request or per-object lifetime
- `Cache::lock()` / `lockForUpdate()` for race conditions
- Failover cache stores in production

### 5. Eloquent Patterns → `references/eloquent.md`

- Correct relationship types with return type hints
- Local scopes for reusable query constraints
- Global scopes sparingly — document their existence
- Attribute casts in the `casts()` method
- Cast date columns, use Carbon instances in templates
- `whereBelongsTo($model)` for cleaner queries
- Never hardcode table names — use `(new Model)->getTable()` or Eloquent queries

### 6. Validation & Forms → `references/validation.md`

- Form Request classes, not inline validation
- Array notation `['required', 'email']` for new code; follow existing convention
- `$request->validated()` only — never `$request->all()`
- `Rule::when()` for conditional validation
- `after()` instead of `withValidator()`

### 7. Configuration → `references/config.md`

- `env()` only inside config files
- `App::environment()` or `app()->isProduction()`
- Config, lang files, and constants over hardcoded text

### 8. Testing Patterns → `references/testing.md`, `references/pest-testing.md`

- `LazilyRefreshDatabase` over `RefreshDatabase` for speed
- `assertModelExists()` over raw `assertDatabaseHas()`
- Factory states and sequences over manual overrides
- Use fakes (`Event::fake()`, `Exceptions::fake()`, etc.) — but always after factory setup, not before
- `recycle()` to share relationship instances across factories

### 9. Queue & Job Patterns → `references/queue-jobs.md`

- `retry_after` must exceed job `timeout`; use exponential backoff `[1, 5, 10]`
- `ShouldBeUnique` to prevent duplicates; `ShouldBeUniqueUntilProcessing` for early lock release
- Always implement `failed()`; with `retryUntil()`, set `$tries = 0`
- `RateLimited` middleware for external API calls; `Bus::batch()` for related jobs
- Horizon for complex multi-queue scenarios

### 10. Routing & Controllers → `references/routing.md`

- Implicit route model binding
- Scoped bindings for nested resources
- `Route::resource()` or `apiResource()`
- Methods under 10 lines — extract to actions/services
- Type-hint Form Requests for auto-validation

### 11. HTTP Client → `references/http-client.md`

- Explicit `timeout` and `connectTimeout` on every request
- `retry()` with exponential backoff for external APIs
- Check response status or use `throw()`
- `Http::pool()` for concurrent independent requests
- `Http::fake()` and `preventStrayRequests()` in tests

### 12. Events, Notifications & Mail → `references/events-notifications.md`, `references/mail.md`

- Event discovery over manual registration; `event:cache` in production
- `ShouldDispatchAfterCommit` / `afterCommit()` inside transactions
- Queue notifications and mailables with `ShouldQueue`
- On-demand notifications for non-user recipients
- `HasLocalePreference` on notifiable models
- `assertQueued()` not `assertSent()` for queued mailables
- Markdown mailables for transactional emails

### 13. Error Handling → `references/error-handling.md`

- `report()`/`render()` on exception classes or in `bootstrap/app.php` — follow existing pattern
- `ShouldntReport` for exceptions that should never log
- Throttle high-volume exceptions to protect log sinks
- `dontReportDuplicates()` for multi-catch scenarios
- Force JSON rendering for API routes
- Structured context via `context()` on exception classes

### 14. Task Scheduling → `references/scheduling.md`

- `withoutOverlapping()` on variable-duration tasks
- `onOneServer()` on multi-server deployments
- `runInBackground()` for concurrent long tasks
- `environments()` to restrict to appropriate environments
- `takeUntilTimeout()` for time-bounded processing
- Schedule groups for shared configuration

### 15. Architecture → `references/architecture.md`

- Single-purpose Action classes; dependency injection over `app()` helper
- Prefer official Laravel packages and follow conventions, don't override defaults
- Default to `ORDER BY id DESC` or `created_at DESC`; `mb_*` for UTF-8 safety
- `defer()` for post-response work; `Context` for request-scoped data; `Concurrency::run()` for parallel execution

### 16. Migrations → `references/migrations.md`

- Generate migrations with `php artisan make:migration`
- `constrained()` for foreign keys
- Never modify migrations that have run in production
- Add indexes in the migration, not as an afterthought
- Mirror column defaults in model `$attributes`
- Reversible `down()` by default; forward-fix migrations for intentionally irreversible changes
- One concern per migration — never mix DDL and DML

### 17. Collections → `references/collections.md`

- Higher-order messages for simple collection operations
- `cursor()` vs. `lazy()` — choose based on relationship needs
- `lazyById()` when updating records while iterating
- `toQuery()` for bulk operations on collections

### 18. Blade & Views → `references/blade-views.md`, `references/tailwindcss.md`

- `$attributes->merge()` in component templates
- Blade components over `@include`; `@pushOnce` for per-component scripts
- View Composers for shared view data
- `@aware` for deeply nested component props

### 19. Conventions & Style → `references/style.md`

- Follow Laravel naming conventions for all entities
- Prefer Laravel helpers (`Str`, `Arr`, `Number`, `Uri`, `Str::of()`, `$request->string()`) over raw PHP functions
- No JS/CSS in Blade, no HTML in PHP classes
- Code should be readable; comments only for config files

### 20. Feature Flags → `references/pennant.md`

- `Feature::define()` to define features with resolver callbacks
- `Feature::active()` / `@feature` Blade directive to check features
- Scope features to specific users/entities with `Feature::for()`
- `Feature::activate()` / `deactivate()` for runtime control

### 21. Monitoring → `references/pulse.md`

- Gate-protect the dashboard with `viewPulse` gate
- Configure built-in recorders in `config/pulse.php` (SlowQueries, SlowRequests, Exceptions, Queues, etc.)
- Redis ingest for production performance; run `pulse:work` to drain the stream
- Custom cards via Livewire components extending `Pulse\Card`
- `Pulse::filter()` to exclude entries; `Pulse::resolveAuthenticatedUserId()` for multi-model apps
- `pulse:check` daemon required for Servers card

### 22. Full-Text Search → `references/scout.md`

- Add `Searchable` trait to models for automatic index sync
- Choose engine: Database, Collection, Algolia, Meilisearch, Typesense
- `toSearchableArray()` to control indexed data; `searchableAs()` for custom index names
- `Model::search('query')->where(...)->paginate()` for search queries
- `scout:import` / `scout:flush` for index management; `scout:sync-index-settings` for engine config
- `Model::withoutSyncingToSearch()` / `SCOUT_DRIVER=null` for testing

### 23. Backup → `references/spatie-laravel-backup.md`

- Schedule `backup:run`, `backup:clean`, `backup:monitor` in console kernel
- Configure sources, destinations, notifications in `config/backup.php`
- Custom cleanup strategies extending `CleanupStrategy`
- Custom health checks extending `HealthCheck`
- Enable encryption and Gzip compression via config

### 24. Media Library → `references/spatie-medialibrary.md`

- Implement `HasMedia` interface + `InteractsWithMedia` trait on models
- `addMedia()` / `addMediaFromRequest()` for file uploads
- Media collections to organize related files per model
- Conversions for image processing (thumbnails, crops, etc.)
- Responsive images via conversion `withResponsiveImages()`

## How to Apply

Always use a sub-agent to read rule files and explore this skill's content.

1. Identify the file type and select relevant sections (e.g., migration → §16, controller → §1, §3, §5, §6, §10)
2. Check sibling files for existing patterns — follow those first per Consistency First
3. Verify API syntax with `search-docs` for the installed Laravel version
